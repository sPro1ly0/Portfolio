                <p>My curiosity in coding began when I volunteered in a study as a requirement for my psychology lecture in university about three years ago. The study involved us learning how to code in JavaScript for beginners. After the study, I wanted to learn more because I love learning about how things work in our world. Last year, I started to pick up coding again as I became interested in how hacking works and started to learn a little bit about Python.</p>

                <p>I am currently a web developer student at Bloc. I enjoy the challenges and useful information in front-end development so far. I love using my creativity in designing websites. I am also a volunteer tennis coach at the high school I went to and give private tennis lessons. I’ve been playing tennis since I was very young and I can’t live without it. My other interests include: hiking, cooking, drawing, travel, and turtles.</p>
